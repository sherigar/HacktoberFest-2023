// Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. 
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

// Problem Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int water = 0;
        int i = 0, j = height.size() - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            int h = min(height[i], height[j]);
            water = max(water, (j - i) * h);
            while (height[i] <= h && i < j) i++;
            while (height[j] <= h && i < j) j--;
        }
        return water;
    }
};
